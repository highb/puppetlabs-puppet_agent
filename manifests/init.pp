# == Class: puppet_agent
#
# Upgrades Puppet 3.8 and newer to the requested version.
# Makes Puppet 4 upgrades easier by migrating SSL certs and config files to the
# new Puppet-Agent paths and removing deprecated settings that are no longer
# supported by Puppet 4.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [arch]
#   The package architecture. Defaults to the architecture fact.
# [collection]
#   The Puppet Collection to track. Defaults to 'PC1'.
# [is_pe]
#   Install from Puppet Enterprise repos. Enabled if communicating with a PE master.
# [package_name]
#   The package to upgrade to, i.e. `puppet-agent`.
# [package_version]
#   The package version to upgrade to. Defaults to undef, meaning only upgrade from Puppet < 4.0.
# [service_names]
#   An array of services to start, normally `puppet` and `mcollective`.
#   None will be started if the array is empty.
# [source]
#   The location to find packages.
